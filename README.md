# Audio recognizer

This project is both my graduation thesis and my (almost) very first Java project.

The idea is to try and extract fingerprints from given Audio sample, and to have them matched against database of
pre-processed audio files (songs :-)).

All the code is written with readabillity in mind. What that means is that it's highly unoptimized.

P.S. Project is still being worked on!
